## Feedback

I'm new to React, so if you don't mind to help me, you can give me an advice to make my code better.

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/BestPractice`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some BestPractice'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/BestPractice`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
